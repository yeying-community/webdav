# Authentication Design

This document summarizes the authentication system: Basic auth, Web3/JWT/UCAN tokens, and refresh flow.

## Authenticators

Two authenticators are wired by the container:

- **BasicAuthenticator**: username/password auth (optional no-password mode)
- **Web3Authenticator**: Bearer token auth supporting JWT and UCAN

`AuthMiddleware` selects the authenticator based on credential type.

## Credential Sources & Priority

Extraction order in `AuthMiddleware`:

1. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. `authToken` cookie (treated as Bearer)
3. HTTP Basic Auth

For WebDAV requests with missing credentials, a `WWW-Authenticate` header is returned.

## Basic Auth

- Users live in PostgreSQL `users` table; password stored as bcrypt hash.
- `security.no_password=true` bypasses password check (username only).
- Permissions are derived from `users.permissions` and `user_rules`.

## Resource Access Permission Design

Authentication only establishes identity; authorization is handled by the permission system (independent of Basic/JWT/UCAN),
except UCAN `app:<appId>` caps which also enforce app path prefix and read/write actions.

### Sources & Precedence

- Default permissions come from `users.permissions` (`C/R/U/D`).
- Path rules come from `user_rules`, evaluated in order; first match wins.
- If no rule matches, fall back to default permissions.

### WebDAV Resources

- Permission checks happen before WebDAV handling.
- The logical path is `(user.Directory || user.Username) + request path`, then normalized.
- HTTP method → permission:
  - `GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PROPFIND` → Read (`R`)
  - `PUT/PATCH/PROPPATCH` → Write (`U`)
  - `POST/MKCOL` → Create (`C`)
  - `COPY/MOVE` → Write (`U`)
  - `DELETE` → Delete (`D`)
  - Other methods default to Read
- `Create/Write` also validates that the parent directory exists.

### API / Share / Recycle

- Public share (Share): read-only (download only).
- Share User: permissions come from `share_user_items.permissions`, checked for download/upload/create/rename/delete.
- Recycle: only the owner can recover/remove/clear items.

### Admin Login & User Management

- Admins are allowlisted via `security.admin_addresses` (multiple supported).
- Only allowlisted wallet addresses can access admin user management APIs.
- You can also set `WEBDAV_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` (comma-separated) via env.

## Web3 / JWT Auth

### Challenge & Verify

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Web3Handler
    participant A as Web3Authenticator
    participant R as UserRepository

    C->>H: /api/v1/public/auth/challenge?address=0x...
    H->>R: FindByWalletAddress
    alt User not found
        H->>R: Save(new user with random name)
    end
    H->>A: CreateChallenge(address)
    A-->>H: Challenge message + nonce
    H-->>C: challenge + expiresAt

    C->>H: /api/v1/public/auth/verify (address, signature)
    H->>A: VerifySignature
    A-->>H: access token (JWT)
    H->>A: GenerateRefreshToken
    H-->>C: access token + refresh cookie
```

### Auto-registration

When the address is not found during `HandleChallenge`, the server auto-creates a user:

- Random username (e.g., `QuickFox42`)
- Default permissions `CRUD`
- Default quota `1GB` (`1073741824` bytes)

### Refresh Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Web3Handler
    participant A as Web3Authenticator
    participant R as UserRepository

    C->>H: POST /api/v1/public/auth/refresh (refresh_token cookie)
    H->>A: VerifyRefreshToken
    A-->>H: address
    H->>R: FindByWalletAddress
    H->>A: GenerateAccessToken + GenerateRefreshToken
    H-->>C: new access token + refresh cookie
```

### Password Login (JWT Bridge)

- `/api/v1/public/auth/password/login` accepts username/password.
- User must have a wallet address bound.
- Access/refresh tokens are issued for that wallet address.

### Email Code Login

- Enabled when `email.enabled=true`.
- `/api/v1/public/auth/email/code` sends a login code to the email.
- `/api/v1/public/auth/email/login` verifies email + code and issues tokens.
- When `email.auto_create_on_login=true`, missing emails are auto-provisioned.
- Successful login issues JWT access/refresh tokens and sets the `refresh_token` cookie.

## UCAN Support

- When `web3.ucan.enabled=true`, Bearer tokens that look like UCAN JWS are verified as UCAN.
- Validation includes:
  - `audience` matches `web3.ucan.audience` (default `did:web:localhost:<port>`)
  - capabilities include `required_resource` and `required_action`
  - proof chain verification (SIWE / ed25519 proof)
- On success, issuer `did:pkh:eth:<address>` is mapped to a user.

### Resource / Action Details (for DApp Integration)

UCAN capabilities are expressed as: `cap: [{ resource, action }]`. The server turns
`web3.ucan.required_resource` and `web3.ucan.required_action` into a required capability
and checks it during authentication. Matching rules:

- **Empty values**:
  - Both empty: no capability check (only UCAN verification).
  - Only `resource` set: `action` is treated as `"*"`.
  - Only `action` set: `resource` is treated as `"*"`.
- **Matching semantics**:
  - `"*"` matches any value.
  - Suffix `"*"` means prefix match (e.g. `webdav/*` matches `webdav/foo`).
  - Otherwise, values must be equal.

> Current implementation only checks whether the required resource/action is present,
> **it does not** map UCAN actions to WebDAV method-level permissions,
> except `app:<appId>` caps which are used for app path read/write enforcement.

### UCAN Resource Permissions for Login

- `resource/action` are opaque strings with no fixed enum; the supported scope is defined by `web3.ucan.required_resource` / `required_action`.
- UCAN only gates authentication via required capability checks; it **does not** replace the user's `C/R/U/D` permissions or rules.
- For app-level directory isolation, set `required_resource=app:*` and `required_action=read,write` (or `read`, plus `create/update/delete/move/copy`); the server enforces path prefixes based on `app:<appId>` with `app_scope.path_prefix`.

#### How a DApp should choose resource/action

Use the server configuration values (`web3.ucan.required_resource` / `required_action`),
and include at least one capability entry that satisfies them.

**Recommended for WebDAV app isolation**:

```json
{
  "cap": [
    { "resource": "app:dapp.example.com", "action": "write" }
  ]
}
```

To grant read-only access to another app directory, add another capability:

```json
{
  "cap": [
    { "resource": "app:dapp.example.com", "action": "write" },
    { "resource": "app:foo.com", "action": "read" }
  ]
}
```

**DApp-side appId & caps (browser example)**:

```ts
const appId = window.location.hostname.toLowerCase();
const caps = [
  { resource: `app:${appId}`, action: 'write' },
];
const extraReadApps = ['foo.com', 'bar.org'];
for (const otherAppId of extraReadApps) {
  caps.push({ resource: `app:${otherAppId}`, action: 'read' });
}
```

> Avoid using `app:*` or `app:xxx*` in UCAN caps, which would bypass directory isolation.

## Cookie & Security Notes

- Refresh token is issued as `refresh_token` cookie with `HttpOnly`.
- `Secure` flag is determined by TLS or `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
- Access token is returned in response body and must be stored client-side.
